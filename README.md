Hack-a-thon Project

This project creates a centralized database, with the tables being found in createTables.sql. Clients can access it through the html and php pages, and entries are inputted into the database. The server was hosted with Apache, and the database was hosted with MySQL. 

This project narrowly missed being placed in the top 3, and was personally commended by the head judge regarding its Facebook integration for the clients to use to help locate nearby food banks, and to help connect the providers with the food donators.
